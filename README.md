# Dungeon-game
Dungeon game made for CS2 final project.
This was a simple game made for my final project in my CS2 class. There is more I wished to do with this like, adding more DnD like elements, such as rolling to attack and having characters armor class and such.
Also more simple things like branching paths, as unfortunately it is a linear dungeon, and it would be fun to have higher possiblity for differing experiences.
